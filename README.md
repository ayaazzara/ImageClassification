# ImageClassification
This project was made to complete “Machine Learning for Beginner” course from Dicoding Academy.   In this project, I used Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train and make a model to classify rock, papers, cissors images. I also used adam optimizer, categorical_crossentropy loss function for multi-class classification model, and callbacks to stop training model when the accuracy is greater than 95%.
